/*
This entire file is purely for documenting things in this robot code to clarify things (especially things written differently from the WPIlib website).

Notes:
Any lines that ends with "= null;" is exluded from this robot code as it is not necessary to run the code.

Website used to help program this robot code (and all of the FritzBot-Revived):
    https://frcteam3255.github.io/FRC-Java-Tutorial/programming/driving_robot.html

Keywords (words from Tutorual -> words from here):
    Drive = differentialDrive
    leftSide = leftMotors
    rightSide = rightMotors
    FL = leftFrontTalon
    RL = leftBackTalon
    FR = rightFrontTalon
    RR = rightBackTalon
    DRIVETRAIN_FRONT_LEFT_TALON = DRIVETRAIN_LEFT_FRONT_TALON
    DRIVETRAIN_REAR_LEFT-TALON = DRIVETRAIN_LEFT_BACK_TALON
    DRIVETRAIN_FRONT_RIGHT = DRIVETRAIN_RIGHT_FRONT_TALON
    DRIVETRAIN_REAR_RIGHT-TALON = DRIVETRAIN_RIGHT_BACK_TALON
    *MotorControllerGroup = SpeedControllerGroup
    *SubsystemBase = Subsystem

    * = these words are the newer verison and the older verison of it isn't compatible with newer VSC/WPIlib version (2022).
